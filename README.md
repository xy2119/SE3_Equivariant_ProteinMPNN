<!-- ABOUT THE RESEARCH -->
<h2 id="about-the-research"> :pencil: About The Research</h2>

**ProteinMPNN** is a message passing neural network that aims to find an amino acid sequence that will fold into a given structure. The full network is composed of an encoder and a decoder with 3 layers each. The network takes as inputs the 3D coordinates and computes the following information for each residue: (i) the distance between the N, CÎ±, C, O and a virtual CÎ² atom, (ii) the CÎ± âˆ’ CÎ± âˆ’ CÎ± frame orientation and rotation, (iii) the backbone dihedral angles, (iv) the distances to the 48 closest residues.

Building rotation invariant representation using [**Sperical Harmonics**](https://stevejtrettel.site/code/2022/spherical-harmonics), 3D coordinates of residule are expanded into radial and spherical basis, the combination of coefficients constitute an invariant representation.
